# Facebook Code Lab

The Facebook Code Lab is a comprehensive coding environment designed to simulate a real interview from the comfort of your home. It was created by Facebook in collaboration with InterviewBit to help students and professionals who may be interested in a career in engineering, to get practical experience on the types of coding questions tech companies ask in interviews. We hope that by using Code Lab, users gain a better understanding of the coding abilities tech companies require.
